A basic architecture for a discord bot using NodeJS with NPM => Discord.JS
(By basic I mean there is no events handler)
# Requirements for Stable Usage & Things you should keep in mind(not really required)
1. Some knowledge of the JavaScript Language and how to use NPM
2. A hosting platform to keep your bot online 
Examples:
-Heroku
-Repl.it
-Glitch.it
-Self Host
4. Some knowledge of how programming works
5. This is not designed to teach you the JavaScript Language and/or any other languages and only serves as a template
6. Don't misuse Discord Bots, like using them to raid, massDM, cause chaos, etc. in servers. 
7. Try to write the code yourself and don't just copy and paste if your trying create a really good working bot
8. It is a tedious and tiring process to create a good bot

# How to use:
1. Install NodeJS and NPM/YARN (preferably NPM)
2. Install an IDE or set up your terminal for your programming environment
3. Download the code below
4. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/
5. And follow the normal steps to get a bot into a server
6. Import the code/Unzip the code into your IDE
7. Place your token into the file called `config.json`

8. In your console/terminal type `npm discord.js`
9. Then after discord.js is done installing, use the following command to get your bot running `node .`
10. If you did the steps correctly the console should have things saying a command is loaded, if not look over your work, if you need more help feel free to drop a question on my discord below

If you have a concern, question, or a suggestion free feel to use my contacts below. For questions that involves things to do with the OS such as NPM's EACCESS errors or other errors, I will try my best, but its best to consult a specialist.
